# Prereqs
- rbenv or other Ruby version manager (app currently depends on Ruby 3.3.5)
- not required but this uses volta for managing node versions. you should check it out https://volta.sh/

# Rails application
There is a barebone rails application that exposes the following routes:

- GET /api/places -> returns a list of places in the db
- GET /api/place/${id} -> returns information about a singular place
- POST /api/add_review -> takes a hash of `{place_id:, author_name:, review_text:, rating:}`

To run the app locally run the following (uses a local sqlite database):
```
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
$ rails server
```

You should now be able to curl 127.0.0.1:3000/api/places and see results

# next application
1. ```cd  takehome_front```
2. ```npm install```
3. ```npm run dev```

# Assignment

Implement a frontend application (Vue.js, Next.js, or other framework of your choosing).  Your
application does not need to be served through Rails.
1. Display a place & any reviews for that place
2. Add a component that lets someone add their own review
3. Add a new endpoint (in Rails) that allows the editing an existing review & implement the frontend for editing

Other notes:
- There is no mock that you need to match, you will not be scored on how pretty the application
looks.
- You're free to change the responses from the rails endpoints to better suit your needs.
- Do not worry about permissions for adding or editing reviews -- allow anyone to add a review
or anyone to edit any of the reviews.
- You do not need to write tests (frontend or backend)
